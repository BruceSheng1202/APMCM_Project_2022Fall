# APMCM_Project_2022Fall
This is the project detail in the contest [2022 APMCM (亚太杯数学建模竞赛)](http://www.apmcm.org/detail/2453), which predicted global average temperature in 2050 and 2100, discussed various factors that might affect and raised some suggestions. Second Prize was awarded for this project. The detail of this problem can be seen [here](https://github.com/BruceSheng1202/APMCM_Project_2022Fall/blob/main/2022%20APMCM%20Problem%20C.pdf). And the [final report](https://github.com/BruceSheng1202/APMCM_Project_2022Fall/blob/main/Final%20Paper.pdf).This endeavor, although initially undertaken with a degree of naivety, proved to be a profoundly significant experience that ignited my passion for Marine, Atmospheric and Sustainability Science. 

### Abstract：

Global climate warming is a natural phenomenon driven by the continuous accumulation of the greenhouse effect. This paper presents predictions for the global average temperature in 2050 and 2100, along with an in-depth exploration of various factors influencing global temperature trends. Based on our discussions and speculations, we propose recommendations to mitigate global warming.

In addressing Problem 1, within Section (a), we employ bootstrap simulations to model temperature increase distributions for both yearly and monthly intervals, establishing confidence intervals for statistical inference. Our findings reveal that the increase in global temperature observed in March 2022 exceeded any previous 10-year period.

In Section (b), we construct two predictive models for global average temperature: linear regression and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), with LSTM demonstrating superior predictive performance. Subsequently, in Section (c), we utilize the LSTM model for temperature predictions. Our projections indicate that 67% of data points will experience temperatures exceeding 20°C, with this percentage expected to rise to 71% by 2100. The global average temperature is predicted to surpass 20°C by 2100.

Turning to Problem 2, within Section (a), we leverage the insights gained from Problem 1 to demonstrate the year-on-year increase in global average temperature. Employing DecisionTree analysis, we discern the relationship between temperature and geographical location, effectively visualizing our findings with heat maps.

In Section (b), our focus shifts to the association between average temperature, fires, and greenhouse gases. Using a linear regression model, we investigate the correlation between fires and average temperature. Our fitting results confirm a strong connection between average temperature and the scale and severity of fires. Subsequently, we employ heat maps to affirm the substantial relationship between greenhouse gases and global average temperature. Based on these findings, we conclude that greenhouse gases are the primary drivers of global temperature change, leading to a series of recommendations for mitigation strategies.
